## What is a Low FODMAP diet?

The Low FODMAP diet, developed by Monash University, has gained popularity in recent years, however it is not a diet suitable for everyone. The three-step diet has been offered to many as a potential treatment option to ease the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other gastrointestinal issues.

FODMAPs is an acronym for a group of carbohydrates that humans cannot digest properly:
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li>F- Fermentable</li>
<li>O- Oligosaccharides</li>
<li>D- Disaccharides</li>
<li>M- Monosaccharides</li>
<li>and</li>
<li>P- Polyols</li>
</ul>

These carbohydrates do not get broken down in our digestive system instead, FODMAPs enter your large intestine where they get fermented by the gut bacteria. In the general population, this would not lead to negative gut symptoms. However, for some people with IBS, this process can worsen common symptoms associated with IBS.

The Low FODMAP diet involves restricting or eliminating foods that are high in FODMAPs, such as certain fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy products, and sweeteners. The goal of the diet is to reduce symptoms like bloating, gas, cramps, and diarrhea by reducing the amount of fermentable carbohydrates in the diet.  


##### Common FODMAPs include:

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li>Fructose: a sugar commonly found in many fruits and vegetables, and most added sugars.</li>
<li>Lactose: a sugar found in dairy products like milk.</li>
<li>Fructans: found in many foods, including grains like wheat, spelt, rye and barley.</li>
<li>Galactans: found in large amounts in legumes.</li>
<li>Polyols: sugar alcohols like xylitol, sorbitol, maltitol, and mannitol. They are also found in some fruits and vegetables and often used as sweeteners.</li>
</ul>

Our unprocessed foods don't come with a list of all of their components. So how can you be certain which foods you should eat or avoid? 

The table below shows some of the foods that you should enjoy and avoid. If you'd like a personalized list of low and high FODMAP foods please [contact me](contact.html).

#### The phases of the Low FODMAP diet

##### Phase 1

The first phase of the Low FODMAP diet involves a strict elimination phase, where high FODMAP foods are avoided for a period of 2-6 weeks. This is the most difficult part of the diet, as it involves pretty extreme restriction of many common foods. The elimination phase of the diet is aimed to reduce your symptoms to be able to determine the foods that cause your symptoms.

##### Phase 2

The second phase involves the reintroduction of the previously avoided foods in a controlled manner. Adding in certain high FODMAP foods one by one over the span of a couple of weeks will allow you to pinpoint exactly which FODMAP causes your flare ups.

##### Phase 3  
Phase three is the final stage and can be started once trigger foods are identified. This final phase of the diet involves a modified long-term dietary plan that includes the avoidance of trigger foods and the inclusion of low FODMAP alternatives.  


#### Should you consider a Low FODMAP diet?
There are a few things to consider before embarking on a Low FODMAP diet.

It may be tempting for people struggling with digestive issues to jump into the Low FODMAP diet to try to manage their symptoms, but it is important that you resist this urge. Issues with digestion and the gut often share common symptoms and can be difficult to distinguish between without professional help. This is important because you may have a digestive issue that is causing harm to your digestive tract without proper treatment. Due to this itâ€™s vital to speak to a medical professional and obtain a diagnosis, before embarking on the Low FODMAP diet.

Research suggests that the Low FODMAP diet can be effective in reducing symptoms of IBS and other gastrointestinal issues in about 75% of individuals diagnosed with IBS. So, even with a formal diagnosis, this diet may not help properly manage your symptoms. This will most likely be recognized in the first phase of the diet and an alternative treatment should be sought out. Additionally, while the diet may provide relief from symptoms, it is not a cure for the underlying condition and may not be suitable for long-term use for everyone.  

#### How to choose your support?

It is important to note that the diet is highly complex and will require guidance from a health care professional to ensure that it is followed correctly and does not result in nutrient deficiencies.

Your best support system for this is a health care professional who has been trained in the Low FODMAP diet. Many nutritionists and dietitians can obtain additional training from Monash University and acquire a certificate in treating IBS with the Low FODMAP diet. This certificate will ensure that you are getting your information from someone who has appropriate knowledge and background with this diet to make the process as easy and stress free for you as possible.

In conclusion, the Low FODMAP diet is a promising dietary approach for managing symptoms of IBS and other gastrointestinal issues. While the diet may not be suitable for everyone, it can be a valuable tool for those seeking relief from digestive discomfort. Thus, it is important for individuals to work with a healthcare professional to determine if the diet is appropriate for their specific needs and to ensure that it is followed correctly. Through my FODMAP diet certification I was able to create a [FODMAP package](1_services.html)  that offers you the support you will need to successfully tackle this diet!
