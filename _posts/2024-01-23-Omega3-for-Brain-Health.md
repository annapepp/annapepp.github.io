Our brain is our most important organ, it functions as the command center for our entire body. Trying to maintain its health and function takes priority for most when discussing longevity and health. A nutrient that has been tied to the health of our brain is Omega-3, as numerous studies indicate that eating plenty of Omega-3 will help improve brain function. 

### What is Omega-3?
Omega-3 is a type of fat, more specifically a polyunsaturated fat. Now you might be thinking what does that mean? We have two main types of fats, saturated and unsaturated, where saturated fats have no double bonds in its chemical structure and unsaturated fats have one or more double bonds. Unsaturated fats are considered to be the healthy fats in our diet and you can easily tell them apart from saturated fats, as they tend to be liquid at room temperature. 

Omega-3s are polyunsaturated, so they have multiple double bonds in their structure, and are said to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. There are three forms of Omega-3, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and alphalinoleic acid (ALA), however, DHA and EPA are the forms that have been tied to improvements in brain health. 

### How does Omega-3 help your brain? 
Omega-3 offers protection against the negative impacts of inflammation by decreasing pro-inflammatory molecules and increasing inflammation resolving molecules. This allows for the control of our immune cells that try to fight off the inflammation by damaging the brain. Omega-3 is also an antioxidant, which means it can protect the body from oxidative stress and allow for normal cell functions. Oxidative stress impacts the brain by causing damage to the structure of the brain and sometimes even lead to increased cell death rates.

### Sources of Omega-3
Your body cannot produce Omega-3 in any of its forms, so it is very important that you make sure you have plenty of it in your diet. 

People who eat fish are at a benefit when it comes to meeting the required Omega-3 intakes, as the most abundant source of Omega-3 can be found in fatty fishes. Fish are high in DHA and EPA, which as mentioned before are the two forms of Omega-3 that have been tied to improving brain health. Now the major question is can you just eat any fish to reap the benefits of Omega-3s. Fatty fishes will be more abundant in Omega-3s; using the SMASH acronym will help you remember which fish are considered the best.


<ul>
<li>S – Salmon</li>
<li>M – Mackerel</li>
<li>A – Anchovies</li>
<li>S – Sardines</li>
<li>H – Herrings</li>
</ul>

Eating 2 servings of these fatty fishes, imagine a serving as the size of a deck of cards, twice a week will ensure that you reach optimal Omega-3 intake.

For people who do not eat fish, certain types of microalgae and algal oils contain DHA and EPA that are comparable to levels in fish. Our bodies can also transform ALA, which can be found abundantly in plant-based foods, to DHA and EPA. Our body is not very efficient at this conversion, so for people following a plant-based diet it is recommended to consume a higher dose of ALA, than for those who are getting their Omega-3 from DHA and EPA. Walnuts and flaxseeds will be the most abundant source of ALA in plant-based foods, 1-2 oz of either walnuts or flaxseeds will have the daily recommended amount of ALA to keep your brain healthy.

### Supplements
If you feel you are still not getting enough Omega-3s through your diet (you can get this checked through an Omega-3 blood test), supplementing may be appropriate. There are a myriad of different Omega-3 supplements on the store shelfs out there all claiming to be the best. Choose a supplement that aligns with your dietary restrictions and needs. There are both good plant-based and fish-based Omega-3 supplements that could help you meet your requirements. Please speak to a healthcare professional before deciding to take any supplement to make sure it is safe for you.
