Every day we get bombarded with contradicting new health “discoveries” posted all over social media by different "health influencers". This can easily create confusion for readers and lead to a mistrust within the nutrition community. I cannot debunk all of the misinformation that is currently out there, but I can try to offer a few tips on how you can try to debunk them and find information that is going to be more scientifically accurate. 
<br/>

## Know who your information is coming from 
Unlike Registered Dietitian (RD), Nutritionist is a title that is not protected by the government in most countries. Consequently, anyone can claim to be a nutritionist even when they lack the educational background to do so. The [UK’s Association for Nutrition](https://www.associationfornutrition.org/) is one organization that is trying to change this by providing registered status to nutritionist coming from an accredited program. This ensures a high standard of practice amongst their nutritionists. Looking for RD, ANutr, or RNutr titles are a quick and easy way to see if the person is qualified to be discussing nutrition. If these titles are not present, check to see if they have sufficient qualifications and university education in nutrition or dietetics.

## Relies heavily on personal anecdotes
It’s very easy to hear personal stories of a specific diet or miracle food/supplement and think it will work for you as well. These narratives often represent extremes and as such, are intended to invoke strong emotional responses. On the other hand, a well designed and executed emotionless scientific study will tell you what works and under what conditions it works, and what the dangers are. When it comes to your health, it is a safer bet to listen to scientific evidence rather than just emotional anecdotes. 
<br/>

## Offers a cure all
If a product or food is suggested as a miracle cure that sounds too good to be true, it probably is. It is very likely that the claims behind these products or foods are part of a marketing scheme. These claims often have little or no evidence backing them up. Usually it’s a safe bet to stay away from these products and the people who advertise them.

## Suggests one dietary pattern that everyone should follow
Similar to what I described with the personal anecdotes, what works for someone may not work for you for many different reasons. Anyone who offers a diet that they claim will work for everyone, lacks nuanced education in the field of nutrition. Working with a certified nutritionist or dietitian will allow you to explore evidence based and personalized strategies that take into consideration your wants and needs.

## Conclusion
With just a little bit of extra digging, you'll be able to separate the truth from the myths and make informed decisions about your health. By following these tips, you can rest assured that you're getting reliable and accurate information from a trusted source. Remember, knowledge is power when it comes to your health!
