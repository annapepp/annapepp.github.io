Hi, my name is Anna and I want to help make nutrition simple for you! Ever since social media gained popularity, nutrition misinformation has been at an all-time high. My goal is to help you navigate this confusing world and create sustainable changes that bring out the best in you. My practice takes a weight neutral and food first approach to provide optimal support and help for all of my clients. 
 

I received my degree in Nutrition from [King’s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/about/history) where I became experienced with a multitude of nutritional concerns. I am also registered in good standing as an Associate Nutritionist with the Association for Nutritionists. 

Areas of expertise: 
<ul>
<li>IBS and FODMAPs</li>
<li>Fueling for sport</li> 
<li>General health and wellbeing</li>
</ul>


Let me help you achieve your goals, while making food fun again!
